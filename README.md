A tool for verifying the status of web URLs. This project is a 48-hour challenge to learn Go.

## Progress

- [x] **Day 2:** Concurrent checking (Goroutines & Channels) and final polish

Well my 48 hours are up! I'm pretty happy with what I did considering it was my first time ever using Go. Also considering my laptop broke and I had no access to a PC for 18 or so hours certainly made it feel like a REAL challenge. I'm quite fond of this tool and will likely continue to improve on it over time despite the challenge being over however, the 48 hours are documented [here](LOG.md).
